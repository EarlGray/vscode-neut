# vscode-neut

This is a vscode extension to support the [Neut programming language](https://vekatze.github.io/neut/).

Functionality:

- it activates `neut lsp` on opening a folder containing `module.ens`
- basic syntax highlighting


> [!NOTE]
> - the `neut` binary must be installed separately
> - `lsp neut` only works in directories with top-level `module.ens`
